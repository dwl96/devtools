# DevTools
A fully offline developer toolkit, built for macOS. Created by [dwl](https://github.com/dwl96).

# Purpose
Having to go to a _different_ website every time you want to check a `JSON` file, or match a `RegEx`, or even validate a `JWT` is time consuming. You first have to find a website that matches the criteria you want. Then you have to decide if the website _seems_ safe enough to enter in your information.

`DevTools` was created to solve this. All of your favourite tools in 1 box. **Completely** offline. And open-source, to ensure that your data **never** leaves your machine.

# Existing tools
